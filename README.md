# Story!

"This is Beetle Steve"

![Image of Beetle Steve](../assets/beetleSteve.png)

"Beetle Steve is sad and alone."

He doesnt think he is much value to the world.

He doesnt have a bunch of arms to carry a bunch of things like some of the cooler bugs.

And all the other bugs make fun of his big, stupid horn.

Poor, poor beetle steve. 

No one understands his suffering.

Beetle Steve often goes on long, lonely walks, to soak in his self-contempt.

On one walk, Beetle Steve encounters a talking rock, as one often does when they go on such walks.

"Oh boy, a hero! ", Says the rock.

"Oh, noble Beetle, please, I need your help! I'm in my darkest hour! At rock bottom, you could say. (heh) "

"I have been stuck here for many years, for I have no arms or legs. For I am just a humble rock."

"But you are a mighty Beetle. God, you're so cool, with your arms and legs and shit."

"Please, carry me somewhere nice."

"I'm sorry, rock. But I'm not capable of anything. I don't think I can help you out." Said Beetle Steve.

"No Beetle Steve. You ARE capable. More capable than you could ever imagine."

"All I ask...."

"...is that you do your best."

"Please pick up some of my rock friends along the way, if you see them!"


##Gameplay

Move Beetle Steve around with the arrow keys. Avoid enemies as you gather your rock friends. The more rocks Beetle Steve carries, the more hits he can take! 

## Launch

Pay the game at:

https://conorgar.github.io/beetle-steve/

## major problems & solutions
- Collision detection for a free-roam div
- Room navigation using several different rooms(or levels) on a single page

## MVP
Move player around and "pick up" items. Win the game when pick up 3 items.

## Next Steps
Would like to add some story screen before the game and after the player wins. The win effect now is pretty rough. Also would like to do proper z-indexing for player so is properly in front/behind necessary objects.
